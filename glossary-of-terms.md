# Linnia Protocol's Glossary of terms (Feb 18)

1. **Attestation** -An attestation is a very general structure. It can be used as proof that a certain identity makes a claim about another identity. TLDR: Data signature from a trusted source
2. **Blind computation** - Computation over encrypted data (doesn't give a third party information about what you have inside
3. **Bountry and staking schemes** - ***Bounty***: typically ETH or tokens locked in a smart contract and given to those who accomplish a certain action. ***Staking***: Locked ETH or tokens are given as a Bond to the Smart Contract that enables others to trust that the user will not behave in a way we don't want, as it would not be profitable to him. Check Proof of Stake and Payment channels for more info.
4. **Data Exchange protocol** - A protocol to exchange data and money between different parties
5. **Facets** - Identity-in-context.  For instance, in the context of a person's “health facet”, both medical and driving data may define a person's identity.
6. **Game Theory** - Mathematical proof that cheating does not (always) pay
7. **Game-Theoretic Network "Actors" ("Equilibria")** - Point in the system where no actor benefits from changing strategy, as they would lose money. Same concept than an equilibrium in physics, but for system human behavior design. More information, or more specific ask Diego. (This is economics).
8. **Garbled Circuits:** A cryptographic protocol which allows two parties to verify  the integrity computation over encrypted data without the need of third-parties. 
9. **HD Wallets** - local brain wallet Check BIP32
10. **Homomorphic Encryption:** A form of encryption which allows computation over encrypted data where the result is the same as if the computation was done on plaintext. There are two kinds of Homomorphic Encryption (*somewhat* homomorphic encryption and *full* homomorphic encryption). The first one allows only to do ether addition or multiplication over the cipher text. Full Homomorphic on the other hand allows both operations.
11. **Hub & Spoke Legibility** - The current way by which large-scale tech enterprises have an inward flow of data describing all of their users. The enterprise owns the user's data.
12. **Identity Singleton** - All of the information related to an identity contained in one instantiation.  The single collection of data that an individual can use to coordinate all of their actions across a network.  
13. **Individual Legibility** - Ability for an individual to express information to society about their identities in a trusted way, and without a central authority, in order to get what they want
14. **IPFS** - decentralized storage (inter planetary file system)
15. **Lagrange Interpolation** - The Lagrange polynomial is the polynomial P of lowest degree that passes through all the points of a certain data set ( i.e interpolation of this dataset by the Lagrange polynomial). In Shamir secret sharing, we use this interpolation formula to calculate the value of P(0), which equals the shared secret value.
16. **Legibility**- The ability of identities to express data about themselves to their networks (communities, enterprises, governments, social circles, etc) in a trusted way.
17. **Merkle DAG** - Directed acyclic graph using merkle hashing. Check IPFS WP
18. **Network Agency** - Ability to have people trust our data so we can engage with a network
19. **n-sided cooperation** - The opposite of zero-sum games.  When competition strategies are dominated by cooperation. 2. The ability of multiple individuals to exchange permissions and view each other's data
20. **Non-agency information asymmetries** - Lack of access to information about an identity that results not from that identities desire to keep it private, but instead from the cost of making it legible (i.e. cost of completing a search).  
21. **Self-sovereign data** - The core component of Web3.0, where your data is wholly owned and controlled by you and not by any outside entity.
22. **Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)** -A cryptographic protocol which allows sharing a secret by dividing it into multiple pieces and each piece will be shared with one part only.
23. **Secure MultiParty Computation (sMPC)** - A cryptographic method which allows multiple servers to compute functions over encrypted data.
26. **Verified computation** - A method to enable untrusted parties to do the computation of some function while keeping a proof of the computation in order to verify the correctness of the computation later on.
